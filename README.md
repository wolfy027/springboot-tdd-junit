# Unit Testing Objectives
We will writing contact management unit test code with the purpose of just testing the contact management service. In particular, the add contact method. Since we're isolating our testing to just the service component unit, we are going to mock our data access component. So for this test, we'll see something that we didn't have to worry about in our integration test.
